This website is a curated list of influential, well-received, interesting OR often-mentioned papers in the area of ubiquitous/pervasive computing.

Great work is (too) often stumbled upon accidentally, or heard of anecdotally. 
The goal of this website is to allow experienced researchers to share the (in their opinion) papers they would recommend their own PhD students to read before performing work in this field.
