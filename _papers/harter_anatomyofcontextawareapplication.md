This paper describes a sensor-driven platform for context-aware computing. 
It shows how mobile users can be tracked inside buildings using sensors (e.g., ultrasonic tags) to determine their 3D location. 
The system makes this context available to applications, enabling them to adapt behavior (such as user interfaces or actions) based on where the user is, how fast they’re moving, or whether they’re with others. 
The work demonstrates a vision for ubiquitous computing, raising challenges around sensor design, privacy, and infrastructure.
