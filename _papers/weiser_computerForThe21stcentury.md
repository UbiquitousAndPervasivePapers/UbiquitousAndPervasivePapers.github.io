Mark Weiser’s “The Computer for the 21st Century” (1991) envisions a world of ubiquitous computing, where computers become so small, cheap, networked, and embedded in everyday objects that they “disappear” into the background of daily life.
He proposes three classes of devices — tabs (inch-sized), pads (foot-sized), and boards (yard-sized) — each suited for different tasks. 
Weiser argues that for this vision to work, devices must be location-aware and numerous, creating an environment of hundreds of tiny computers per room. 
Rather than creating virtual worlds (as in virtual reality), ubiquitous computing augments the real world. 
The goal is “calm technology”: systems that inform without demanding attention.
